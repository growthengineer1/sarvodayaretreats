About Sarvodaya

Body:
Sarvodaya—meaning "universal uplift" or "welfare of all"—is derived from Sanskrit: sarva (all) and udaya (rise, welfare). This retreat embodies that philosophy: a space where everyone who enters experiences genuine care, connection, and growth.
We believe retreat isn't about escaping life—it's about returning to yourself. Here, you'll find space to create, practice, swim, and simply be.

FINAL NOTES
This website should feel like stepping into a calm, artistic space. Every element—from color choice to spacing to illustrations—should evoke the feeling of Sarvodaya: peaceful, intentional, authentic, and deeply connected to both art and nature.
The design draws inspiration from The North's sophisticated minimalism and hand-drawn aesthetic, but tailored specifically to a backwater retreat focused on universal uplift and genuine care.
When implemented, this should create a beautiful, professional online presence that accurately represents Sarvodaya Retreats as an intimate, artistic, philosophical space for transformation.
